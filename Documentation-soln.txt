Africa Soil Property Prediction Challenge Solution
My Score : 0.42980


Method :


Step 1 :
# Finding relevant variables , feature reduction :
Since , this data set had a large number of features find correlation using df.corr() was not a good option  and also feature reduction did not lead to betterment of outcomes .


Step 2 :
# Outlier detection :
The standard method I used was plotting BoxPlot of each output variable and looking for possible outliers :
The outcomes were :
All P > 1 were outliers .
All SOC > 2 were outliers
All Ca > 1 were outliers
All pH> 2 were outliers
And sand had no outliers .


All possible combinations were tried .
All gave better outcome in the in-sample dataset but were not so good on out-sample data . The outliers in P though when removed gave optimum results both in the in-sample and out-sample datasets .
So , finally only Outliers in P were removed as all others were affecting the prediction accuracy and were not necessarily useless .


Step 3 :
# Choosing regression technique :


 Linear :
This is a regression analysis , so we can choose many techniques , linear is not good , as the number of features is way too large and the outputs may not necessarily follow the linear trend .


SVR:
The main difference to ordinary regression is that the  SVM regression function f(x) will not change when adding additional data points (y_i, x_i) as long as  f(x_i) does not deviate more than a certain margin epsilon  from y_i. Furthermore, further deviations are, in effect, penalized linearly instead of quadratically. As a third difference, the objective function also contains a quadratic term penalizing too high absolute pre - factors of x. This is referred to as "flatness" and I do not understand the rationale behind it. . 
Thus in this case it was a very good algorithm to use and the one which i used to get the final outcome. 


DecisionTreeRegressor
DecisionTreeRegressor also does a similar task , but due t very large number of r=features  , the results in SVR were much better than DecisionTreeRegressor .
